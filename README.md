# ü§ñ Social-Bot-Detection

A hybrid deep learning approach for detecting automated bot accounts on Twitter using LSTM and dense neural networks.

## üìù Introduction
Social media platforms like Twitter face significant challenges from automated bot accounts that can:
- Manipulate public opinion
- Spread misinformation
- Disrupt genuine user interactions

## üéØ Problem Statement
- Growing presence of automated bot accounts
- Difficulty in distinguishing between human and bot content
- Need for accurate, real-time detection mechanisms

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations
Existing solutions often rely on:
- Single feature analysis
- Basic classification methods
- Limited feature extraction

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### Data Processing
#### Text Processing
- Tokenization of tweet text
- Padding sequences to uniform length
- Text cleaning (removing digits, punctuation)

#### Feature Extraction
- User mentions count
- Hashtag count
- Organization and Person entity percentages

### Model Architecture
```python
model = {
    "Text Branch": {
        "Embedding Layer": "Word embeddings",
        "LSTM Layer": "Sequence processing"
    },
    "Numeric Branch": {
        "Dense Layer": "Numeric feature processing"
    },
    "Combined": {
        "Concatenation": "Feature fusion",
        "Dense Layers": "With dropout",
        "Output": "Sigmoid activation"
    }
}
