# Social-Bot-Detection

## Research Problem
The problem involves detecting automated bot accounts on Twitter (now X) that spread misinformation and manipulate public opinion. This is significant because:

* Bot accounts can artificially amplify certain messages
* They can manipulate trending topics and discussions
* They potentially influence user behavior and opinions

## Research Gap
Based on the code implementation, this project addresses these key gaps:

* Existing solutions often focus on single features (like text only or metadata only)
* Previous approaches may not handle real-time detection effectively
* Many current solutions don't combine both text and numerical features for classification
